# UI Building
The Flutter code in this repository represents a user profile page. The main HomePage widget combines various custom widgets to create an engaging user interface. The UI includes a dynamic curved header with a background colour, user information displayed at the centre, circular avatars, a "Following" button, and additional interactive elements. The code utilizes Stack, Column, and Positioned widgets for precise layout and positioning, while custom widgets like MyCustomClipper, CircularAvtar and MeanuPage enhance the UI functionality. The use of Flutter's rich widget library allows for a responsive and visually appealing user experience.
